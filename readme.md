# My Readme File (Information Architecture)
 
 My readme file is about three seperate ground infantry based combat units in the United States Marine Corps. These units are the plane jane infantry units, division reconaissance battalions, and force reconaissance companies. These units all share the commonality of being apart of the United States Marine Corps, as well as being infantry based ground combat units.

 The domain is three combat units in the USMC

## USMC Infantry Units 

The Marine Corps Infantry units are the bread and butter, the "Main Effort" of the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Infantry is organized in multiple regiements, each regiment is subservient to one of three Marine Divisions (1st, 2nd, & 3rd). Within each regiments are multiple battalions, each of which contain companies which inturn contain platoons. The mission of Marine Corps infantrymen is to locate close with and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver, and repel enemy assault by fire and close combat. There are many different roles and occupational specialties that fall under infantry, but the most important is by far the riflemen, whose job is to engage with the enemy.

## USMC Division Reconaissance 

The Marine Corps Division Recon Marines are infantrymen with advanced training in parachuting, combatant diving, patrolling, stealth tactics, and close combat tactics. This special training is necessary for their specialized mission of conducting amhibious reconaissance, special reconaissance, target aquisition, terminal guidance, and limited scale offensive raids. Divison Recon is organized in three battalions that are in turn owned by one of the three MarDivs. For example, 1st Recon Battalion belongs to 1st MarDiv. Marine Recon is are essentially infantrymen that have gone through a tough crucible and received advanced training that allows them to conduct uncovnetional operations.

## USMC Force Reconaissance 

The Force Reconaissance units in the Marine Corps are an even more specialized version of the Divison Recon Battalions. Force recon Marines go through nigh identical training as division recon counterparts, except Force Marines place more heavy emphasis on close combat skills, dynamic assualt tactics, and long range special reconaissance. Their mission differs in that they are more oriented towards conducting longer range intelligence gathering missions, as well as high impact kinetic raids on high value targets with the likely hood of heavy close contact with the enemy.
